                                Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?   <br />
                                Shaoguan Ye:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;My ideal job hasn’t changed because this is exactly how my ideal job is, as I am a bit lack of organisation skills, writing and planning. In choosing of future job, the general skills needed are more important to me because sepecific skills can be learned but just by the matter of time, but general skills can not be mastered very easily.<br />
                                Zeyi Wu:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;It seems like that the industry's demand for game developers is relatively low, so I think I should be more flexible when choosing a job, such as working in a software company. Because I really like my job, I will try my best to work in the gaming industry.<br />
                                Chenhao Lu:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;I haven't changed my mind about my ideal career. It doesn't rank high in skills, but it pays the right salary and it fits my interests. I think a proper salary and a job in line with my interests are the most important things to me.<br />

                                &emsp;&emsp;Basic on these information from different years. I can get one feedback is the machine learning engineer is a high level requirement job compare to others. So it has too much work skills need to learn. That’s why it got higher salary. I think this job actually is a good job, but not suitable for my first job in the future. I need to think deeply and have a change perhaps.<br />
                                Jiageng Chen：<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;I can't find my job, but according to the data on burning glass. I can know that when I work, I need some important skills to be recruited by the employer, such as communication skills, problem-solving skills and so on. They are all skills that employers like very much. I don't think I have changed my idea of idea job because the knowledge and personal ability required for this job are very strong, so I should study hard. .<br />

                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>
                                Firstly, please tell us about your work, what exactly do you do?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;I am a software engineer. Mainly responsible for coding, architecture design and other related work to ensure the project from project approval to online, and operation and maintenance in the later period.<br />

                                <br />Please tell us about the industry you work in. For example, what do you feel about your work?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;I am mainly engaged in bank IT related work. I think the banking system business process is very complex, the system boundary is also very wide. To work in such an industry, in addition to being a developer, also need to learn more banking knowledge. Now the information age has come, what we need is to use technology to drive business, so that the development of business more secure, more convenient.<br />

                                <br />Can you describe in detail what it would be like to have a system with very wide boundaries?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Refers to the bank involved in a particularly broad range of business, involving a particularly broad range of technology. The business level is very complex, professional knowledge is required.  In technical level functional requirements are also complicated, the need for linkage of many systems, in order to deploy for the sake of security will also have the provisions of the line as well as to ensure the safety and performance of some basic requirements.<br />

                                <br />You said you are a software development engineer so do you have to be responsible for security?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Security can be said to be a concern at both the coding level and the architectural level. Code level, attention should be paid to the specification of the code, the protection of the key information (such as IP, or URL, log output), from the aspect of architecture, such as in order to ensure the continuity of the business, we would consider cluster deployment, backup to other cities, will be considered by a digital signature to verify the identity or tamper-proof, when connect to the external system, also can use some mechanism to isolate environment inside the industry and the environment outside of the industry.<br />

                                <br />Could you tell us about what other works you have to do?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;In addition to coding and system design, we usually need to carry out requirements analysis together with business personnel. After having a general understanding of the requirements, we will determine the way to carry out the project, then conduct the summary design and system design, and summarize them into documents. We need to write a lot of documentation, because we must understand the requirements and risks of the project before development, to avoid unnecessary labor waste. For some new technologies, we also need to conduct research in advance, or do a small demo to verify whether the technical scheme is feasible.<br />

                                <br />Could you tell us more about the different people you interact with in your work?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;We will contact the department personnel who put forward the project requirements, they are usually product managers, but also contact the front-line business personnel, who carry out the project acceptance, and we will also carry out systematic q&A. On the technical side we also deal with other technical departments in the industry. For those outside the industry, we will have access to the technical and business personnel of the regulatory authorities, as well as the technical and business personnel of other commercial Banks during inter-bank coordination.<br />

                                <br />Does that mean you often work with people from different departments in your daily work?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Of course, communication is an important safeguard at work, and it is more important to know the purpose of the business people's requirements than to copy the requirements on paper.<br />

                                <br />Will your work have opportunities to contact customers?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Due to the functional characteristics of our department, our work does not contact with customers, which is actually quite good for us, because direct pressure on customers is quite great.<br />

                                <br />Can you tell us more about your collaboration and interaction with other IT departments?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;The division of labor in each of our departments is quite different. For example, we are working on the application system to meet the needs of business personnel. Other departments will be specially responsible for some basic functions, such as OCR identification, printer and scanning. There will also be responsible for doing in-line program packaging, there will also be do IDE development platform. We will consult on the design of these issues, or include them in the co-organization of our project to assist the project.<br />

                                <br />So does your department usually work on its own?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;This depends on the type of project, and for general projects, most of them need to be co-organized.
                                I see. So cooperation with other departments is also very important.Indeed it is.

                                <br />What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Communication and testing. Because of the particularity of the business, we have to learn the content related to the business. In the case of testing, many problems are discovered through joint inspection, and it is difficult for unit testing to find problems.<br />
                                <br />So instead of spending time in the development phase, will it take more time to communicate and test?<br />
                                Yes, because coding is controllable, requirements and testing are hard to control.<br />

                                <br />How long does a typical test take?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;This is also related to the size of the project, which generally accounts for 30% of the project.<br />

                                <br />How long has the test lasted before?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;One or two years, because the requirements are issued in batches, while developing and testing.<br />

                                <br />Could you tell us about the common problems encountered in the test?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Often it's the business people, testers, developers who have a different understanding of the requirements, or the test environment itself, or the inter-system coordination.<br />

                                <br />Which aspects of work do you find most challenging?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp; When you're an architect, because in addition to thinking about the requirements of the business, you have to think about how the data gets from line to line, you have to understand the architecture of the system, you have to think about the regulatory requirements, you have to think about security, you have to be clear about all aspects of the project.<br />

                                <br />Could you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Before, when we were doing a function, we designed it very perfectly, abstracted the business into an N-cross tree, grabbed the official document information of the business through the script, and made the system into a way of configuration upgrade. These are two ways to ensure the accuracy of business upgrades and validation. But after system puts online, it is not preferred by business people, because on the one hand, the interface is not beautiful, because we take into account the performance problems, the interface appearance didn't make any adjustment, check the information on the other hand, although there is a validity (regular expression matching), but not specific enough, so although business people know that it is wrong, but they don't know how to correct the wrong. Therefore, In my opinion, commercial Banks, whose main body is business driven, should pay more attention to the needs of business personnel. Besides the tasks that are difficult to be completed, the purpose of bank informatization should also make it more convenient for business personnel to use. The essence of IT is still for the convenience of people's life, the blind pursuit of technology may sometimes put the cart before the horse.<br />

                                <br />Finally, do you have any advice for people who are going to work in IT?<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;IT is better to lay a solid foundation before entering the job and learn more about the mainstream technologies used by IT. Don't limit yourself to one language, because all languages are interlinked. Learn one, and usually master the others within a month. The key is to learn the framework, the tools, the programming mindset, to understand the underlying, to understand the system, to understand how a technology is implemented. There are a lot of things you can't learn from books, but if you have a basic knowledge in advance, and can have a basic classification and understanding of the technology, you will learn very quickly later.<br />

                            <p>
                                Cybersecurity:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Cybersecurity means that the hardware, software and data in the networking system are protected, and would not be easily damaged, altered and revealed from any accidental or malicious  reasons, so that the system can operate continuously and reliably. Cybersecurity usually refers to the security of internet, but in fact it can also refer to the security of computer communication network.
                                The basic meaning of security is that there is no threat objectively and there is no fear subjectively. That is, the object does not worry about its normal state being affected. Cybersecurity can be defined as a network system is free from any threat and infringement, can normally achieve the function of resource sharing. In order to realize the resource sharing function of the network normally, the hardware and software of the network should be ensured to run normally, and then the security of data and information exchange should be ensured. Due to the abuse of resource sharing, cybersecurity problems are caused. Therefore, the technical approach to network security is to implement limited sharing.
                                Driven by the vigorous development of network equipment and network application market, the network security market has ushered in a period of rapid development. On the one hand, with the extension of the network, the network scale rapidly expands, and the security problem becomes increasingly complex. The construction of manageable, controllable and trusted network is also the premise to further promote the development of network application. On the other hand, with the increasing complexity of network services, the security of application layer is a new direction of network security development. With the rapid development of network technology, it is difficult to effectively resist the increasingly serious hybrid security threats. Building a local security, global security, intelligent security of the overall security system, to provide users with multi-level, all-round three-dimensional protection system has become a new concept of information security construction. Under this concept, network security products will have a series of changes. Combined with practical application requirements, under the guidance of the new network security concept, network security solutions are developing in the following directions:<br />
                                <br />Active Defense:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;The idea of active defense has been developing for several years, but there have been many obstacles to moving from theory to application. Active defense mainly analyzes and scans the behavior of the specified program or thread, and determines whether it belongs to the dangerous program or virus according to the pre-set rules, so as to carry out defense or cleanup operation. However, the most important factor in moving from an active defense concept to product is intelligence. Since computers are generated under a series of rules, how to find, judge, detect threats and actively defend against them has become the biggest obstacle for the concept of active defense to enter the market.<br />
                                <br />Security Technology Fusion:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;In the face of the increasingly large and complex network, only relying on the traditional network security equipment to ensure thesecurity of the network layer can not meet the manageable and controllable requirements of the network, so the network management software represented by terminal access solutions began to intergrate into the overall security solutions. Terminal access solution by controlling the user terminal security access networks, the access to the user terminal to enforce user security policy, strict control terminal internet use behavior, provides effective protection for the network security, and help users implement more active safety protection, achieve efficient and convenient network management, comprehensively promote the process of the consturction of the whole network security system.<br />
                                <br />Data Security Protection System:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;The data security protection system is designed with the organic combination of comprehensive data file security policy, encryption and decryption technology and mandatory access control, and implements different levels of security control over various data assets on the information media to effectively prevent the leakage and theft of confidential information.<br />
                                <br />Firewall:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;irewall is through the organic combination of all kinds of software and hardware equipment used for security management and screening, to help the computer network in its internal and external network between the construction of a relatively isolated protection barrier, in order to protect user data and information security of a technology.
                                Function of firewall technology is mainly found in time and deal with the computer network runtime possible security risk, data transmission and other issues, including measures, including isolation and protection at the same time can be implemented on the operations of the computer network security records and inspection, to ensure the security of computer network operation, guarantee the integrity of the user data and information, to provide users with better and more secure computer network experience.<br />

                                <br />The future development of cybersecurity:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Shorten the reflex arc and improve the perceived speed of unknown threat.<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;The safety protection mode has turned to the intelligent control stage.<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Network capacity expansion and security technology coverage expansion.<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Firewall penetration is getting higher and higher.<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;5g network security development.<br />
                                <br />Cybersecurity mainly impact in three different ways:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;Individuals.<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;People get good and bad information from the Internet, and network security can better protect personal information privacy and property security.
                                Network administrator.<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;In addition, it is necessary to master the configuration of trunk devices and the changes of configuration parameters, and backup the configuration files of each device; The network administrator should also adjust the system configuration dynamically as the system environment changes, business development needs and operation user needs parameter, optimisation. This is also growing burden for network administrator.
                                <br />Organisations:<br />
                                &emsp;&emsp;The cybersecurity budget will be significantly increased for any organisations as it is growing faster and faster.<br />
